$ file Makefile

returns
Makefile: makefile script, ASCII text

#General
Malloc allocate a block of memeory of the heap
Heaps are tree like datastructures


I try to execute the make file returns this 

gcc: error: heapedit.c: No such file or directory
make: *** [Makefile:2: all] Error 1

# Question is how to view the heapedit and lib.so.6 files
