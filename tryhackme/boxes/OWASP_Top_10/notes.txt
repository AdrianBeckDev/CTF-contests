###Notes of the Box OWASP TOP 10 on tryhackme.com

OWASP #1 Injection

- Basic Point is that you can spawn a reverse shell with netcat in an input dialog that allows you to access that machine.
- To find out that this input dialog execute commands just type some commands in it



OWASP #2 Broken Authentication

- Sometimes SQL injection works
- You can registrate multiple users wih the same username, but you can then login with the same rights as them to the server by simply adding e.g. a space before the username/


OWASP #3 Sensitive Data Exposure

- Look for databases that are saved under the root dir of the webserver. It may contain some useful informatin :)



OWASP #4 XML External Entity

- XML often allows attacker to communicate with the backend systems
- Two types XXE attacks
	-> in-band: Attacker receives immediate response to the XXE payload
	-> out-of-band: no immediate rrespones from the web app -> attacker has to reflect the output of their XXE payload to some other file on their own server.

- What is XML?

- defines a set of rules -> makes docs human readable and machine readable
- Markup language for storing and transportating data
- XML simplifies data sharing between various systems -> platform independent

- What is DTD in XML?
!DOCTYPE -> defines the root of the document


- #XXE Payload
- simple payload that allows you to access sytem files



OWASP #5 Broken Access control

- getting access  to files and directories via misconifgs

	//First Scenario
	- app uses unverfieded data in a SQL call that is accessing account information
	//Second Scenario
	- Browsing to URLs with Admin privelges
	

IDOR Challenge:

-Idor is a type of access control vulnerability
-Change ulr parameters to access other users on that system



#OWASP 6 Security misconfig

https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A6_2017-Security_Misconfiguration.html



#OWASP 7 Cross site scripting

- Is a type of an injection

Stored Xss: Don't remove the bad parts of the user input
Reflected XSS: payload is part of the victims request to a website
DOM-Based XSS: Make XSS room!

XSS payloads

http://www.xss-payloads.com/payloads/scripts/portscanapi.js.html

- Best thing to learn this is to mess around with the box xxe playground




#OWASP 8 Insecure Decentralisation

- Replacing processed data with malicous code

//Deserialization

Process of converting obejcts in programming into simpler compatible formatting for transmitting between systems or networks for further processing or storage( or in reverse )

//Cookies

Remote Code Execution

Cookie hacking is fun 



#OWASP 9 Components With Known Vulnerabilities

Cookie hacking is more fun than ever. Just read instructions. Tryhackme covers this quite easy.

#OWASP 10 


How to read log files.

Pretty selfexplanatory
